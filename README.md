# Ravelry-Recommender-Engine

### Goal:
Create a knitting pattern recommender engine for Ravelry

### Probelm:
Ravelry (https://www.ravelry.com/) has cornered the market in terms online knitting and fibre art content. Nearly any pattern can be found in it's database. The website is well laid out with a fabulous search menu - if you know what you're looking for, but if you don't you can get lost for hours trying to dig through the hundreds of thousands of obtions.  In the words of Steve Jobs "".

Kniitting is a hobby known for destressing or relaxing.  There is a heavy time commitment, and monetary investment for the materials required for each project, and because of the shear number patterns, picking out the next project to start can be quite stressful.  

The problem this project aims to solve is making this selection process easier, by providing pattern recommendations to the user, when given a particular pattern the user enjoyed or likes. 

I'll be focussing on knitting for this project as it's a hobby I've been doing for over three decades and more confortable assesing recomendation level of success than the other fibre arts. 

### About Ravelry
Ravelry is a free indie-website started in 2007 which supports documenting fiber art projects. 

It is part 
* comminuty-edited yarn and pattern database,  
* part social networking service - hosts knit-alongs and other activies, and 
* part marketspace where patterns and supplies can be bought directly designers and individuals. 
 
Members share projects, ideas, collections of yarn and tools.  Because it's so community driven, nearly any fiber pattern can be found and reviewed.
