# Ravelry-Recommender-Engine

### Goal:
Create a knitting pattern recommender engine for Ravelry

### Probelm:
Ravelry (https://www.ravelry.com/) has cornered the market in terms online knitting and fibre art content. Nearly any pattern can be found in it's database. The website is well laid out with a fabulous search menu - if you know what you're looking for, but if you don't you can get lost for hours trying to dig through the hundreds of thousands of obtions.  In the words of Steve Jobs "A lot of times, people donâ€™t know what they want until you show it to them".

Knitting is a hobby known for destressing or relaxing.  There is a heavy time commitment, and monetary investment for the materials required for each project, and because of the shear number patterns, picking out the next project to start can be quite stressful.  

The problem this project aims to solve is making this selection process easier, by providing pattern recommendations to the user, when given a particular pattern the user enjoyed or likes. 

I'll be focussing on knitting for this project as it's a hobby I've been practicing for over three decades and more confortable assesing recomendation level of success in that area rather than the other fibre arts. 

### About Ravelry
Ravelry is a free indie-website started in 2007 which supports documenting fiber art projects. 

"The community [needed] an independent, not for-profit, decentralized, community owned database of patterns, yarns, and their connections to projects". - Ravelryco-founder Cassify 

Members share projects, ideas, collections of yarn and tools.  Because it's so community driven, nearly any fiber pattern can be found and reviewed.

## Progress Report:

Nov19
- MAJOR snag - turns out you need id's for patterns, going to be resource and time consuming to gather data
- sent email to team, hoping for response, but starting brainstorm alternative ideas, and moving forward
with this one - with fingers crossed
- working on accessing, cleaning data 
- data exploration 
- 
Nov 18 
- picked a topic! And started documentation
- facing hurdle of actually starting, and worried about data size, what features to keep
- another hurdle is I'm not confident in recommender systems...yet! 
- api accessing and getting the data 

Next steps:
- yarn recommender 
-
